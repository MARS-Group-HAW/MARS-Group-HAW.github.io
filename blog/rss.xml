This time, the focus was on the use of agent-based modelling to address social-ecological problems and research questions. The five-day course was held in Gqeberha/Port Elizabeth, South Africa, from September 12–16, 2022.</p><p>Twelve participants from various disciplinary backgrounds within the social and ecological sciences attended the short course. Most of them were PhD candidates or postdocs who wanted to explore the possibility of integrating agent-based modelling into their research. The short course included the following topics, among others:</p><ul><li>Multi-agent modelling and simulation using MARS</li><li>Formulating and sharpening a research question</li><li>Developing conceptual models to base an implementation on</li><li>Working with temporal and spatial data</li><li>Visualizing and analyzing simulation results</li></ul><p>We look forward to further collaborations with the attendees and to holding more short courses in the future!</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Scientific Congress for High School Students is involved in research on all matters related to climate change. This year, the Klimakongress 2022 was hosted at the Technical University of Hamburg (TUH).</p><p>With more than 600 students, faculty members, and guests from the Hamburg metropolitan area, the event was a true success and gave an insightful glimpse into the possible responses to climate change from the scientific community.</p><p>The MARS Group was also represented at the event and held a workshop on agent-based modelling for traffic simulations as part of the presentation of the <a href="https://www.haw-hamburg.de/hochschule/technik-und-informatik/departments/informatik/unser-department/computer-science-for-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computer Science for Future (CS4F)</a> initiative.</p><p>For more information, please visit the Klimakongress website <a href="https://www.nat.hamburg/schwerpunkte/klimawandel/klima-kongress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
