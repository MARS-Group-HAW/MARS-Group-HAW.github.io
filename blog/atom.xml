For the MARS Group, it has become an annual tradition to attend and contribute. This year, we will share our progress and initial results from an agent-based traffic model for the KNP. The model spans the entire road network of the KNP and models daily routines of commuters, visitors, and Open Safari Vehicle (OSV) drivers. We hope that the model will be a valuable tool for <a href="https://www.sanparks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SANParks</a> management as they decide how to manage traffic flow and density in their national parks to reduce traffic jams and improve the visitor experience.</p>]]></content>

The five-day course was held in Gqeberha/Port Elizabeth, South Africa, from September 12–16, 2022.</p><p>Twelve participants from various disciplinary backgrounds within the social and ecological sciences attended the short course. Most of them were PhD candidates or postdocs who wanted to explore the possibility of integrating agent-based modelling into their research. The short course included the following topics, among others:</p><ul><li>Multi-agent modelling and simulation using MARS</li><li>Formulating and sharpening a research question</li><li>Developing conceptual models to base an implementation on</li><li>Working with temporal and spatial data</li><li>Visualizing and analyzing simulation results</li></ul><p>We look forward to further collaborations with the attendees and to holding more short courses in the future!</p>]]></content>
